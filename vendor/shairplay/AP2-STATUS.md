## Open / Unwired — scaffolding present, not connected

Implemented building blocks that are **not** wired into the runtime path. Kept
deliberately (behind `#[allow(dead_code)]`) as the foundation for these features —
do **not** delete them as "dead code"; they are unfinished AP2 capabilities.

- **PTP timing → multi-room precision** — the PTP UDP listener now matches
  two-step Sync/Follow_Up packets, feeds their local-to-master offset into
  `PtpClock`, and maps `SETRATEANCHORTIME` onto buffered-audio local playout time.
  A sender anchor in the future is held until its mapped local deadline; if PTP
  is unavailable, buffered audio retains its best-effort local fallback.
  Delay-request/path-delay compensation and realtime-stream PTP scheduling are
  still open, so this is not yet a claim of sample-accurate multi-room sync.

- **Outbound event reporting** — the encrypted event channel is established and the
  initial `updateInfo` is pushed at SETUP, but the receiver never sends events
  afterward. `EventSender::send` (held in `RaopConnection::event_sender`,
  `src/raop/event_channel.rs`) is the API for this; wire calls to it on receiver-side
  state changes (volume / now-playing / progress) for fuller AP2 event reporting.

> Related already-wired gap closed in 0.6.0: `AudioHandler::on_error` was defined but
> never called — now wired. The two items above are the remaining "built but unwired"
> AP2 capabilities.

## Video — Working (iOS 18)

**Screen mirroring is working.** iPhone screen successfully mirrored and
displayed in a window. The full pipeline is proven:

1. FairPlay key exchange (fp-setup M1/M2)
2. AES-128-CTR video decryption
3. H.264 decode (openh264) + display (minifb)

### Key Discovery: UxPlay Feature Set

The breakthrough was using UxPlay's exact feature bitmask:

```
Features = 0x527FFEE6 (bit 27 "legacy pairing" OFF)
```

With this feature set:
- iPhone **skips pair-setup and pair-verify entirely**
- iPhone sends `ekey` (72 bytes, FairPlay-encrypted) directly in SETUP
- No ECDH hash needed — raw FairPlay-decrypted key goes to Stage 3
- No AP2 bits (40, 41, 46, 48) — pure legacy protocol for video

### Video Key Derivation (Working)

Two-step process (no ECDH hash when bit 27 is off):

```
Step 1: aeskey = playfair_decrypt(keymsg_164, ekey_72)              → 16 bytes
Step 2: key    = SHA-512("AirPlayStreamKey{id}" || aeskey)[0..16]   → 16 bytes
        iv     = SHA-512("AirPlayStreamIV{id}"  || aeskey)[0..16]   → 16 bytes
```

Where `{id}` is the `streamConnectionID` from the type 110 SETUP, formatted
as unsigned decimal (`PRIu64`).

### Critical Bug Found: Truncated FairPlay Tables

The Rust port of `playfair_decrypt` had **6 truncated lookup tables** from the
original C-to-Rust conversion. Rust zero-filled the missing bytes, causing
`playfair_decrypt` to produce wrong keys silently:

| Table | Declared | Actual | Missing |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| TABLE_S1 | 10240 | 9600 | 640 |
| TABLE_S2 | 36864 | 34560 | 2304 |
| TABLE_S3 | 4096 | 3840 | 256 |
| TABLE_S4 | 36864 | 34560 | 2304 |
| TABLE_S9 | 1024 | 256 | 768 |
| TABLE_S10 | 4096 | 3840 | 256 |
| STATIC_SOURCE_2 | 47 | 46 | 1 |

Tables regenerated from original C source (`playfair/omg_hax.c`).

**⚠️ This bug invalidated ALL previous video decryption research.** Every
"tested approach" that failed was tested with a broken `playfair_decrypt`.
The previous conclusion that "iOS 18 doesn't send ekey" was wrong — it does
send ekey, but only with UxPlay's feature set (no AP2 bits).

### Current FairPlay Status

FairPlay decryption is implemented in safe Rust. The generated lookup tables are
checked in as Rust constants and are covered by test vectors.

### Previous Research — Needs Re-verification

Earlier video-key research was conducted with the broken `playfair_decrypt`
implementation and may no longer be accurate:

- "iOS 18 doesn't send ekey for screen mirroring" — **WRONG.** It does, with
  UxPlay features (`0x527FFEE6`).
- "ECDH hash is required for video key" — **WRONG for legacy mode.** With bit 27
  off, no pairing occurs and the raw FairPlay key is used directly.
- "All 13+ key derivation variants failed" — **All tested with wrong FairPlay key.**
  Need to re-test with AP2 features if AP2+video is desired.
- "Screen mirroring audio (type 96 usingScreen) has no shk" — Needs re-testing
  with UxPlay features.

### Current Limitations

- **No AP2 audio with video** — UxPlay features disable AP2 buffered audio
- **openh264 decode errors** — Software decoder struggles at 30fps in debug mode
- **No screen mirroring audio** — Type 96 `usingScreen` audio not yet wired up

### Stream Type 120 — Video Relay (Not Implemented)

Sent by YouTube, Apple Music (music videos), and other video apps. The SETUP
contains only `{"type": Integer(120)}` with no additional fields. Likely HLS
video relay where the app sends a video URL for the receiver to fetch directly.

### TODO
- [ ] Test AP2+video hybrid features (can we have both AP2 audio and video?)
- [ ] Wire up screen mirroring audio (type 96 `usingScreen`)
- [ ] Improve H.264 decode stability (release build, error recovery)
- [ ] Re-test previous key derivation approaches with correct FairPlay key

### HLS with AP2 Audio

HLS video playback (`/play`, `/playback-info`) is pure HTTP — it relays an
m3u8 URL to the application and doesn't use the RTP audio pipeline. The
`hls` feature now retains the AP2 buffered-audio feature profile and advertises
the HLS capability without enabling the legacy screen-mirroring feature mask.
The application handles `/play`, `/rate`, `/scrub`, `/stop`, and
`/playback-info`; the sender can therefore control the Windows media pipeline
without replacing the known-good AP2 audio configuration.

## Known Issues (Resolved)

### RC Connection Delay (~10s) — FULLY RESOLVED ✅

Previously, the iPhone opened a "Remote Control Only" RTSP connection ~10 seconds before starting the audio connection.

This has been **fully resolved** by:
1. Deriving a **stable and deterministic Pairing Identifier (`pi`)** from the receiver's MAC address (advertised consistently in mDNS).
2. Correctly completing the GET `/info` response plist payload to return `"pi"`, `"name"`, `"macAddress"`, and `"deviceID"`.
3. Binding and returning a proper `eventPort` in the `isRemoteControlOnly` SETUP response plist, and spawning the encrypted event channel handler.

With these changes, the trust relationship is established instantly, and audio streaming begins in under 50ms without any delay!

## AP2 Remote Control — Research

Third-party AP2 receivers cannot send playback commands (play/pause/skip) to
the iPhone. AP1 DACP remote control is fully implemented and works.

See previous sections for full remote control research (unchanged).

## Test Coverage

130 tests, 17 C-verified vectors from pair_ap reference implementation:
- TLV codec, HKDF-SHA512, ChaCha20 transport framing
- ADTS framing, audio packet decryption, server keypair
- Anchor time calculation, channel mixdown, SSRC mapping
- Full M1→M4 SRP integration test over real TCP
- Video cipher streaming AES-CTR partial block tests
- FairPlay cross-validation test against C `playfair_decrypt` output
