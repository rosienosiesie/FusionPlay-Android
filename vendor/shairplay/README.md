A complete AirPlay audio and video receiver as a Rust library. Supports both classic AirPlay (AP1) and AirPlay 2 (AP2) with buffered audio, encrypted transport, HomeKit pairing, and screen mirroring. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

**This is a clean-room Rust implementation — not a wrapper or FFI binding.** Every protocol handler, codec, and cryptographic primitive has been reimplemented from scratch in safe Rust. No C code from shairplay, shairport-sync, or any other project is linked or called.

> ⚠️ **Pre-1.0 notice:** This crate is under active development. Minor version bumps (e.g. 0.1 → 0.2) may include breaking API changes. Pin your dependency to a specific minor version (`shairplay = "0.2"`) and review the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

## Features

|  | Feature | Details |
|--|---------|---------|
| 🎵 | **AirPlay 1 (Classic)** | ALAC decode, AES encryption, DACP remote control — rock solid |
| 🎵 | **AirPlay 2** | Buffered AAC, SRP-6a pairing, ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted RTSP |
| 🔊 | **Multichannel** | 5.1 and 7.1 AAC decode with ITU-R BS.775 mixdown to stereo |
| 🔄 | **Resampling** | Automatic sample rate conversion via rubato |
| 🔐 | **HomeKit pairing** | Transient (PIN 3939) and normal (persistent key storage) |
| 📺 | **Video** | Screen mirroring — work in progress, behind `video` feature gate |
| 🎬 | **HLS Video** | YouTube and other HLS streams — receiver relays URL to app |
| 🌐 | **Cross-platform** | macOS (native Bonjour) + Linux (pure Rust mDNS) |
| 🔒 | **Pure safe Rust** | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, no C code in this crate¹ |
| ⚡ | **Async** | Built on [tokio](https://tokio.rs) |
| 🛎️ | **Error notifications** | Pairing, SETUP, and codec failures surfaced to your app via `AudioHandler::on_error` |

> ¹ The crate itself contains no `unsafe` code. On macOS, mDNS service registration uses [astro-dnssd](https://crates.io/crates/astro-dnssd), which internally calls Apple's Bonjour C API via FFI. On Linux, [mdns-sd](https://crates.io/crates/mdns-sd) provides a pure Rust mDNS implementation with no native dependencies.

## Quick Start

### AirPlay 1 (Classic)

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use shairplay::{RaopServer, AudioHandler, AudioSession, AudioFormat};

struct MyHandler;
impl AudioHandler for MyHandler {
    fn audio_init(&self, format: AudioFormat) -> Box<dyn AudioSession> {
        println!("Stream: {}ch {}bit {}Hz", format.channels, format.bits, format.sample_rate);
        Box::new(MySession)
    }
}

struct MySession;
impl AudioSession for MySession {
    fn audio_process(&mut self, samples: &[f32]) {
        // F32 interleaved PCM — same format for AP1 and AP2
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), shairplay::ShairplayError> {
    let mut server = RaopServer::builder()
        .name("My Speaker")
        .build(Arc::new(MyHandler))?;
    server.start().await?;
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await.unwrap();
    server.stop().await;
    Ok(())
}
```

### AirPlay 2

```rust
// AP2 adds resampling and multichannel mixdown.
// Output is always f32 interleaved PCM — same as AP1.
let mut server = RaopServer::builder()
    .name("My Speaker")
    .output_sample_rate(48000)
    .output_max_channels(2)
    .build(Arc::new(MyHandler))?;

// Or force AP1 mode at runtime (even with ap2 feature compiled in):
use shairplay::AirPlayMode;
let mut server = RaopServer::builder()
    .name("My Speaker")
    .mode(AirPlayMode::AirPlay1)
    .build(Arc::new(MyHandler))?;
```

## Implementation Status

### ✅ AirPlay 1 — Production Ready

Rock solid. ALAC decoding, AES encryption, DACP remote control, metadata (artwork, progress, track info). Works with iPhone, iPad, Mac, iTunes.

### ✅ AirPlay 2 Audio — Production Ready

Full pipeline: SRP-6a pairing → encrypted RTSP → FairPlay → PTP timing → buffered AAC decode → f32 PCM output. Multichannel 5.1/7.1 with ITU-R BS.775 mixdown. Automatic resampling. Both stream types implemented:

- **Type 103 (buffered)** — AAC over TCP with timed playout buffer. Used for music.
- **Type 96 (realtime)** — ALAC over UDP with immediate delivery. Used for Siri, phone calls, system sounds.

Connections are **instant** (starts streaming in under 50ms) using deterministic key persistence and correct `eventPort` handling on `isRemoteControlOnly` channels, matching commercial receiver capabilities.

### 🧪 Video (Screen Mirroring) — Work in Progress

Behind the `video` feature gate. Screen mirroring uses the legacy/UxPlay-compatible
feature set; AP2 buffered audio is intentionally disabled while video is enabled.

The video feature switches to a UxPlay-compatible legacy feature set
(`0x527FFEE6`) to receive screen mirroring data from iOS 18+. AP2
buffered audio is not available — the iPhone falls back to legacy ALAC
(type 96) which is fully supported with FairPlay key decryption and
NTP timing.

Video decryption is implemented for the legacy feature-set path; AP2+video
hybrid operation remains research work. See [AP2-STATUS.md](AP2-STATUS.md)
for details.

### 🔬 Remote Control

AP1 DACP remote control is fully implemented and works.

Third-party AP2 receivers cannot send playback commands (play/pause/skip) to the iPhone. All paths require Apple ecosystem trust:

- **Type 130 MRP data channel** — requires HomeKit seed (Home app pairing)
- **Companion-link protocol** — requires same Apple ID
- **DACP** — iPhone doesn't send Active-Remote header in AP2

See [AP2-STATUS.md](AP2-STATUS.md) for the full research. If you have further insights or want to help investigate, please reach out!

## Example Player

The included example plays AirPlay audio through the system's default output device:

```bash
# AirPlay 1
cargo run --example player

# AirPlay 2
cargo run --example player --features ap2

# With resampling to match output device rate (e.g. 44100→96000 Hz)
cargo run --example player --features ap2 -- --resample

# With persistent device identity (stable MAC + paired keys across restarts)
cargo run --example player --features ap2 -- --persist state.json

# Custom name and interface binding
cargo run --example player --features ap2 -- --name "Kitchen" --bind 192.168.1.100 --persist state.json --resample

# HLS video (YouTube) — requires mpv installed
cargo run --example player --features hls -- --resample
```

Without `--persist`, the device gets a random MAC each run and the iPhone treats it as a new device. With `--persist`, the MAC and paired keys are saved to a JSON file.

Without `--resample`, audio is delivered at the source's native rate (44100 Hz). If your output device runs at a different rate (e.g. 96000 Hz), use `--resample` to convert in the example app.
